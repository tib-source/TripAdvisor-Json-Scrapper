I don\u2019t know how authentic it is as I have nothing to compare it to, however it was full of Ethiopians having lunch, thus seems fairly authentic to me.  The man serving is was very friendly, however it took a very long time for our food to come out, and other tables of locals were being served before us even though they came in after us.  The food was interesting and tasty, although the sour bread became a little monotonous after a while. You need to eat this with every bite as you eat with your fingers (which we actually enjoyed doing).  Good value, especially local beers at \u00a32.50. No service charge and a nice experience. However we are unlikely to return.",

I and my friend went to on a Saturday afternoon, there weren't many people and we thought we found a gem that wasn't crowded. Things went downhill from there, the waitresses were not respondent initially and when they came they were half-assed. we were confused but we managed to order in the end but then they brought us a wrong order which they refused to return, by this time we were already just trying to eat anything and leave asap. The end was the icing on the cake, let's just say we left the food with just one bite. absolutely horrible.",

It was superb, plus its a really nice social way of eating. The stew is just spooned onto the bread, and you all just rip pieces of the bread (which is more akin to a thin pancake) and scoop the stew. Really nice and very inexpensive. Pity the Ethiopian beer had run out as I would have liked to have tried that too - maybe next time.",

        "review": "We visited for lunch. The restaurant was nearly empty. It is an interesting place with eclectic and african decor. A nice smell of frankincense greeted us upon entering. The smell was then complemented by the warmth of servers and patrons alike. We tasted several dishes (there is a flamingo plate for 2-3 people) and they were very good. The portions are very generous and indeed we did not manage to finish our order. This is the usual Ethiopian fare with food served over and with some spongy bread that is then used to eat with your own hands. We very much enjoyed this style of eating (our 3 yo did too) as well as the communal aspect of it (one plate in the center for all of us). We also had Ethiopian Tej (a root fermented with water and honey), good and interesting but a bit strong/aromatic a flavor to have too much of it (a bit like port in a way). Finally, we had coffee with a coffee ceremony that entailed roasting the beans and then serving the coffee in a nice wooden tray with frankincense burning. Very scenographic and interesting, and the coffee was also very good. The only negative of the visit was the timing of service, it took us a bit over two hours for the whole affair at lunch time and with just few other patrons around. It is true there were also quite a few take away orders but I would not go to Flamingo for speed of service, other than that it is a nice and pleasant experience and a great meal, I would reccommend it and 'll certainly go back in other occasions when we have plenty of time to spare.",

Once the bill came and we presented the Taste card it was not accepted as she said the meal portions would have been different if I mentioned it first. It all seemed very confusing as they took the booking knowing it was a Taste card booking but miscommunication caused a bit of a bit of a downer. Mention taste card before ordering.",

When it came to paying the bill, the staff member complained that he had forgotten we had a taste card and had given us full sized portions. He wanted us to pay full price, but finally begrudgingly accepted the taste card.  So expect smaller portions if you come in on a taste card (surely this is not consistent with taste card rules?).",

        "review": "We decided to try Flamingo after reading the recent positive reviews on here, and were extremely disappointed. We would not eat here again. The food was mediocre at best, and the service was terrible and incredibly slow.  We had made a reservation and so were seated immediately (although they did make several people they had just sat at the table get up and move, which was awkward). They left the menus and only returned to take our orders after about 15 minutes. The waitress spoke absolutely no English - not even enough to take our orders, and certainly not enough to answer questions about the food. Even pointing to the items on the menu was hardly enough, and we all ordered the same thing (the sharing platter)!  About 15 minutes later, the waitress came back and relayed that they were out of the appetiser we had ordered, so we ordered a different one. About 10 minutes after that, a different waitress came back and again explained that they were out of the appetiser we had ordered. The first waitress apparently had not understood our second order.  By this point it had been over half an hour, and they still had not brought our drinks or any food. A few minutes later the drinks arrived. One was served in a cracked glass.  After another 30 minutes (so more than 1 hour after we were seated) we still had not been brought any food and no server had stopped by the table to update us. I flagged down a waitress and asked when we might expect to be served. Within 5 minutes of that the food finally arrived.  The food was certainly not as good as other Ethiopian restaurants we have been to. The tej was sour, the injera was dry and the other flavours uninspiring. The largest dish in the \u00a332 sharing platter was a salad of iceberg lettuce and tomatoes. The meat dishes contained very little meat (e.g. a single chicken wing covered in sauce) and were difficult to share between two people. A lot of the dishes that should have been hot were served cold. Perhaps they sat out a long time before being brought to our table.  We will not be going back to this place.",

The \u00a332 price tag for the Flamingo Special is outrageous as it is not plentiful (although, as I say, it was very good and fresh). It was barely enough for two of us. And \u00a39 for the small piece of chicken (I think wing) in the dish my husband chose was also over-priced. I think the prices may be skewed to the Groupon, Discount Voucher customer, i.e. if you get the meal for the 50% or even 30% discount you'd feel happier with the bill. This is sad because the normal paying customer probably won't go back.",

        "review": "Flamingo is an Ethiopian restauraunt located on Goldhawk Road in Shepherds Bush. Having always wanted to try Ethiopian food, my husband and I popped in for dinner on our way home from work last night.  The place was busy, and filled with Ethiopian people, both of which were good omens for our meal. However, that's about where the good signs stopped. Firstly, we were standing in the doorway for a few minutes before being greeted by a flustered waitress, who indicated to the stairs nearby and told us that if we wanted a table, we'd have to go downstairs. So we did. And we waited (in vain) for her to return with menus. Luckily I cottoned on pretty quickly that she wouldn't be returning, so I headed upstairs and grabbed them myself. I noticed that other diners took a while to figure this out.  To her credit, it wasn't long until the waitress took our order, and things were looking up. My husband ordered a \"wot\" with lamb (which the menu told us was a traditional Ethiopian dish), and I ordered the \"alicha wot\" with lamb (a milder version), with traditional injera flatbread. As we were starving we also ordered sambussa to start, which sounded very much like the Indian samosa.  From thereon in, the experience was just bad, bad, bad. So as not to make this review into a novel I will summarise:  - The sambussa starter took over 40 minutes to get to us - The sambussa wasn't just like samosas, it WAS samosas, and the kinds that you get in a bag from the freezer at the supermarket, served up on a piece of lettuce with no sauce at all. - The waitress never returned to take further drinks orders, and when we waved her down and placed an order for a single beer it took over 15 minutes to get to us. Furthermore, after placing the order we saw her immediately take the beer out of the fridge, leave it on the bench, and then wait until we reminded her of our order 15 minutes later (when she finally came back downstairs) meaning it was warm on arrival. - My main (the alicha wat) was simply awful: chopped up injera bread with a knuckle of lamb which had no meat, only lumps of fat, attached, no sauce whatsoever. - Throughout our meal they played traditional Ethiopian music ... this I'm happy with, except that it seemed to be just three songs, played over and over, and at night-club volumes.  The only saving grace is that my husband said that his wot was \"OK\" - at least his had sauce, some meat (though, he says, not much), and didn't involve the chopped up injera bread.  It's a real shame, as I do not think that our experience fairly reflects Ethiopian cuisine in general: I've heard it can be fantastic. The people at the Flamingo just don't do it well.  Positives? My husband thought that the waitress was very pretty. That's about it.  In short - go elsewhere. There are great reviews for places just down the road (I wish I'd checked Tripadvisor first!)",
